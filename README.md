## A littel about Julissas Guzman

Hello Everybody! My name is Julissa I'm glad that I'm starting my new journey with GitHub. I'm an aspired Latinx in Tech. It took me a little longer to decide 

what I wanted to do for my career. I fell in love with the tech industry that I bought the book GitHub for Dummies, Hope I get to learn more than I hope so. 



## My Career Goals in Tech

I would like to build a Start-up but I need to learn how to help current small businesses and understand how to make them successful.

I took the time to invest in myself by learning Data Analytics, Project Managers. I enjoy it so much that I found my calling to Build something 

to help others. 



## My Hobbies  

My first hobby is being a mother I get to be the best mother I can be, I get to teach, Play, Collect toys or Build Legos and Read to him. I learn from him as well we learn together as a family. I also collect Funko Pop toys from action figures to Disney, popular shows. I love to travel with my family I would like to take our son to see the world as he grows older.
